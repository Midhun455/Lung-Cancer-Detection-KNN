This application aims to enable early detection of lung cancer, providing patients with the best chance of recovery and survival using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model. By analyzing thousands of high-resolution lung scans, this model accurately identifies cancerous lesions, significantly reducing the false positive rate associated with current detection technology. This advancement ensures patients receive life-saving interventions earlier and allows radiologists more time to focus on patient care.
